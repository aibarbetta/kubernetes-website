Some other points worth noting are:
- The title does not have to follow the KEP title exactly
- You can talk about multiple KEPs in one section if they are related
- Keep it as short as one or two paragraphs – if you found many interesting points, keep note of them, so that you can use them for the Release Announcement instead
